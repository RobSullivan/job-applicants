# Job applicants exercise for HOD

### Dependencies

SQLite3 was used for this website and while it is easy to use once installed, installing it makes use of node-gyp and all that node-gyp entails. Proceed with care if installing on a Windows machine.

### Otherwise to get up and running:

 - `git clone https://github.com/RobSullivan/job-applicants.git`
 - `cd job-applicants`
 - `npm install` 
 - `npm run sqlite3-start`



### Things to improve
 - ARIA attributes. Only learnt about this incidentally when reading about validation errors here http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/errors/example-form-validation-single-question-radio. Will learn more about them.
 - This was my first use of scss and so I compiled all the govuk_frontend_toolkit scss into css. Only used a very small amount. Next time will select more carefully.
